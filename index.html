    <h3>Education Background</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In Spring 2021, Karen Levy and I taught a new course, Choices and
        Consequences in Computing (INFO 1260 / CS 1340). The course is designed
        at an introductory level with no formal prerequisites, and will cover a
        range of ethical, societal, and policy implications of computing and
        information.

        a Highly Connected World. Cambridge University Press, 2010.
        <ul>
          <li>
            This book is based on an inter-disciplinary course that we teach
            entitled Networks. The book, like the course, is designed at the
            introductory undergraduate level with no formal prerequisites. To
            support deeper explorations, most of the chapters are supplemented
            with optional advanced sections.

            This book is based on the undergraduate algorithms course that we
            both teach. We also use the more advanced parts for our graduate
            algorithms course.
